# **MEMORYWATCH**

## Objective:

* ### *Match as many cards on the board as you can. Each match you make you earn 5 points. Match them all and earn 30 points!*
* ### *You have 5 lives to begin. Each time your selected cards don't match you lose a life. If you reach 0 lives it is game over.*

## How to play:

* ### Each time you click on a card the card will flip over to reveal a portrait of a hero from Overwatch (Mercy, Pharah, Tracer, Reinhardt, Soldier 76, Widowmaker). You can only select 2 cards at a time. If the cards don't match they will both flip back over no longer revealing who is hidden behind them. Try to remember who is hiding there. Try to make as many matches as you can with the secrets that have been revealed to you.

## Background info:

* ### I chose to make a memory game because I always enjoyed how this type of game always challenges the capabilities of your memory. 
* ### I chose to theme it after Overwatch because I've been playing the game since its release and still play it to this day. It gave me a lot of fantastic memories over the years.

## Future plans:

* ### I will introduce a difficulty selection to change the amount of available matches.
* ### I plan to return add several themed features that make this game more unique. These features will draw inspiration from the different abilities heroes have in the game. You would be able to select one of these abilities for use when playing.
* * ### An example is like Tracer's Recall ability in Overwatch could be used to implement something to the effect of an undo button.
